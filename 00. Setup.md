# Installation & Setup Guide

This guide helps you install the required tools and set up your environment to start building on the Stellar testnet.

---

## Install Rust

Rust is required to build and deploy smart contracts on Stellar.

ðŸ‘‰ Install Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

After installation, add the correct WebAssembly (WASM) compilation target:

* âœ… If youâ€™re using **Rust v1.85.0 or higher**, run:

  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32v1-none
  ```
* âœ… If youâ€™re on an **older version of Rust**, run:

  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

You can check your Rust version with:

```bash
rustc --version
```

---

## Install Stellar CLI

The Stellar CLI (`stellar`) lets you generate accounts, deploy contracts, and interact with the network.

### On **Windows**:

* Install via **winget**:

  ```bash
  winget install --id Stellar.StellarCLI --version 22.8.1
  ```
* Or build with **cargo**:

  ```bash
  cargo install --locked stellar-cli@22.8.1 --features opt
  ```

### On **macOS/Linux**:

* Install via **Homebrew**:

  ```bash
  brew install stellar-cli
  ```
* Or build with **cargo**:

  ```bash
  cargo install --locked stellar-cli@22.8.1 --features opt
  ```

#  Configure CLI for Testnet

By default, Stellar CLI operates on the **testnet**, which is free to use and funded by Friendbot.

## Set up an Identity

When deploying a smart contract, you need an **identity** (a keypair) to sign transactions.
You can create one (for example, called `alice`) and have it funded automatically:

```bash
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet --fund
```

âœ… Here:

* `--global` saves the identity globally for reuse.
* `--network testnet` ensures itâ€™s created on the test network.
* `--fund` requests testnet Lumens from Friendbot.

You can create more identities (like `bob` or `carol`) similarly for testing.

### View Identity Details

To view the public key (address) of your identity:

```bash
stellar keys address alice
```

This prints the **public key** youâ€™ll use to receive test tokens or deploy contracts.

### Notes

* The **testnet** is a sandbox environment. Real tokens have no value here â€” perfect for experimenting.
* Identities are just keypairs saved locally, so you can create and delete them freely while testing.
