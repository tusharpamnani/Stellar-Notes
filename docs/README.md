Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building on Stellar! This documentation will take you from complete beginner to confident Stellar developer, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced smart contract development.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers the complete Stellar development journey:

- **Blockchain Fundamentals** - Understanding Stellar's architecture and Soroban smart contracts
- **Smart Contract Development** - Building, testing, and deploying contracts using Rust
- **Frontend Integration** - Creating web applications that interact with your contracts
- **Best Practices** - Security, optimization, and production-ready development

## Who This Guide Is For

- **Beginners** with no blockchain experience
- **Developers** familiar with web development looking to expand into blockchain
- **Rust developers** interested in smart contract development
- **Anyone** curious about building decentralized applications

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Familiarity with command line tools
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start from the beginning** - Each section builds on the previous one
2. **Follow the examples** - Hands-on practice is the best way to learn
3. **Use the workspace** - This repository contains working examples you can run
4. **Ask questions** - The Stellar community is welcoming and helpful

## Quick Start

If you're eager to jump in, here's the fastest path:

1. [Environment Setup](getting-started/environment-setup.md) - Install the required tools
2. [Your First Contract](smart-contracts/your-first-contract.md) - Build and deploy a simple contract
3. [Building a Frontend](frontend/building-frontend.md) - Create a web app to interact with your contract

## What's in This Workspace

This repository contains several example projects:

- **`soroban-hello-world/`** - A simple "Hello World" smart contract
- **`increment/`** - A counter contract demonstrating state management
- **`frontend_hello_world/`** - A web frontend that connects to smart contracts

## Getting Help
