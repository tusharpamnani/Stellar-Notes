# What is Stellar?

Stellar is an open-source, decentralized network that enables fast, cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies. Think of it as a global financial network that connects banks, payment systems, and people.

## The Big Picture

Imagine a world where:
- You can send money to anyone, anywhere, instantly
- Banks can settle international payments in seconds instead of days
- Anyone can create and trade digital assets
- Financial services are accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy

This is what Stellar aims to achieve.

## How Stellar Works

### 1. **Decentralized Network**
Unlike traditional banking where a central authority controls everything, Stellar operates on a network of computers (nodes) that work together to validate transactions. No single entity controls the network.

### 2. **Consensus Protocol**
Stellar uses a unique consensus algorithm called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). Instead of mining (like Bitcoin), Stellar nodes reach agreement through a voting system that's:
- **Fast**: Transactions settle in 3-5 seconds
- **Efficient**: Uses minimal energy compared to proof-of-work systems
- **Secure**: Resistant to attacks and network failures

### 3. **Native Currency: Lumens (XLM)**
Lumens are Stellar's native currency, used to:
- Pay transaction fees (very low, typically less than $0.01)
- Maintain account minimums
- Enable cross-currency transactions

## Key Features

### **Cross-Currency Transactions**
Stellar can convert between any two currencies automatically. For example:
- Send USD, recipient receives EUR
- Send Bitcoin, recipient receives Mexican Pesos
- The conversion happens seamlessly using Stellar's built-in exchange

### **Asset Issuance**
Anyone can create digital representations of real-world assets:
- **Fiat currencies**: Digital dollars, euros, yen
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin, Ethereum tokens
- **Custom assets**: Loyalty points, gift cards, real estate tokens

### **Smart Contracts (Soroban)**
Stellar's smart contract platform allows developers to build:
- Automated financial services
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Complex transaction logic
- Custom business rules

## Real-World Use Cases

### **Remittances**
- Workers sending money home to families
- Lower fees than traditional services like Western Union
- Faster settlement (seconds vs. days)

### **Microfinance**
- Small loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries
- Lower interest rates due to reduced overhead
- Automated loan processing and repayment

### **Cross-Border Commerce**
- Businesses paying international suppliers
- Instant settlement of invoices
- Reduced currency conversion costs

### **Financial Inclusion**
- Banking services for the unbanked
- Access to global financial markets
- Lower barriers to entry for financial services

## Stellar vs. Other Blockchains
