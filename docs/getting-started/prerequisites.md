# Prerequisites

Before diving into Stellar development, let's make sure you have the foundational knowledge and skills needed for a smooth learning experience.

## Programming Knowledge

### **Basic Programming Concepts**
You should be comfortable with:
- **Variables and data types** (strings, numbers, booleans)
- **Control structures** (if/else, loops, functions)
- **Basic data structures** (arrays, objects/dictionaries)
- **Error handling** (try/catch or similar patterns)

### **Programming Experience**
- **Any programming language** is fine—you don't need to know Rust specifically
- **Web development experience** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is helpful but not required
- **Command line familiarity** will make the setup process much easier

### **What You DON'T Need**
- **Blockchain experience** - We'll teach you everything from scratch
- **Rust knowledge** - We'll cover the basics as we go
- **Financial expertise** - Basic math is sufficient
- **Advanced computer science** - High school level understanding is enough

## System Requirements

### **Operating System**
- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **macOS 10.15+** (Catalina or later)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+, or similar)

### **Hardware**
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for development tools
- **Processor**: Any modern CPU (2015 or later)
- **Internet**: Stable connection for downloading tools and deploying contracts

### **Software**
- **Git** for version control (we'll help you install this)
- **Text editor** (VS Code recommended, but any will work)
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** (built into your OS)

## Mental Models

### **Blockchain Thinking**
You'll need to understand these concepts (we'll explain them):
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control
- **Immutability**: Data can't be changed once written
- **Consensus**: How agreement is reached across the network
- **Public/Private Keys**: How identity and ownership work

### **Financial Concepts**
Basic understanding of:
- **Assets**: What can be owned or traded
- **Transactions**: Moving value from one place to another
- **Fees**: Costs associated with operations
- **Settlement**: When transactions become final

## Learning Mindset

### **Patience**
- Blockchain development is different from traditional programming
- Some concepts may seem counterintuitive at first
- Take time to understand the "why" behind each concept

### **Curiosity**
- Ask questions about how things work
- Experiment with the examples
- Don't be afraid to break things (that's what testnets are for!)

### **Persistence**
- Some setup steps may require troubleshooting
- The community is very helpful—don't hesitate to ask for help
- Every developer started exactly where you are

## Time Commitment

### **Initial Setup**
- **Reading**: 30-45 minutes to understand concepts
- **Installation**: 30-60 minutes depending on your system
- **First Contract**: 1-2 hours to build and deploy

### **Ongoing Learning**
- **Daily Practice**: 30 minutes to 1 hour recommended
- **Project Building**: 2-4 hours per week for meaningful progress
- **Community Engagement**: 1-2 hours per week to stay updated

## What You'll Be Able to Do

After completing this guide, you'll be able to:
- **Write smart contracts** in Rust for the Stellar network
- **Deploy contracts** to testnet and mainnet
- **Build frontend applications** that interact with your contracts
- **Understand blockchain architecture** and how Stellar works
- **Contribute to the ecosystem** and build real-world applications

## Getting Help

### **When You're Stuck**
1. **Check the documentation** - Most issues are covered here
2. **Search the community** - Someone has likely faced the same problem
3. **Ask questions** - The Stellar community is welcoming to beginners
4. **Take breaks** - Sometimes stepping away helps solve problems

### **Community Resources**
- **Discord**: [Stellar Discord](https://discord.gg/stellar) for real-time help
- **GitHub**: [Stellar GitHub](https://github.com/stellar) for code examples
- **Forums**: Community discussions and Q&A
- **Meetups**: Local and virtual events for developers

## Ready to Start?

If you have:
- ✅ Basic programming knowledge
- ✅ A computer with internet access
- ✅ Curiosity and patience
- ✅ Time to dedicate to learning

Then you're ready to begin! The next step is [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md), where we'll install all the tools you need.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything perfectly right now. We'll cover each concept in detail as we build real projects together.
